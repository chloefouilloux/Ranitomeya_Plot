# Ranitomeya_Plot
ggplot with Ranitomeya froggie and really cool radial plot

Hello! 

My name is Chloe and I am quite a beginner at coding more complext visual compositions, but have been sick in the hospital and found that this practice was really fun and stress relieving, so I hope you come to like it as well! 

First, I want to start by saying the circular plot has been inspired (and partially taught) by the amazing @ijeamaka, so please give her a follow and check out her code and repo here: https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene/patterns . Another person who does not know I exist, but whose code and viz. has really inspired me is Cedric Scherer. He is super duper cool and also worth checking out!


Second, I want to start with my mistakes! Of course, this is a first attempt for me, so things will only get easier, but here is something I should NOT have done: I combined my plots using cowplot. This is a bit of a quick and dirty force-- I was first inspried by a picture, so imported that and started building on top of that. NO CHLOE. BAD CHLOE. Next time, definitely start with the plot, then expand the panel margins to make room for the picture. So this current plot is more like a Frakenstein and less like a super elegant gown. But, live and learn. 

Most of all, have lots of fun and mess around with the numbers! That's how I learned stuff!

### I hope we have lots of fun!
